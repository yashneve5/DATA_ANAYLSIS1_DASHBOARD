# Project Insights
- Sub-category analysis revealed that Printers generated the highest profit margin, while some categories had high sales volume but lower profitability.

- Monthly profit trends showed consistent growth with minor dips in off-season months.

- Customer segmentation identified a small group of high-value customers responsible for a significant revenue share.

- State-wise performance indicated underperforming regions that may benefit from targeted marketing.

- Payment method trends highlighted UPI and Cards as dominant, suggesting a shift away from cash-based transactions.


# Conclusion
- The dashboard effectively visualizes Nevestore’s core KPIs using Power BI. Through robust data modeling and DAX-based measures, it enables actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends—supporting data-driven business decisions and operational optimization.
